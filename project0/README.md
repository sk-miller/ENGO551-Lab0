## Project Overview

This project is a personal website that showcases my interests as a 4th-year civil engineering student. The website is comprised of four different HTML pages, each focusing on different aspects of my life, including personal background, rowing, family, and civil engineering.

## Files and Structure

- **index.html:** The homepage provides an introduction to me, including a brief bio and links to other sections of the website.

- **rowing.html:** A page dedicated to my passion for rowing, featuring images, descriptions, and a link to all other pages.

- **family.html:** A page dedicated to my passion for my family, featuring images, descriptions, and a link to all other pages.

- **engineering.html:** A page dedicated to my passion for engineering, featuring images, descriptions, and a link to all other pages.

- **index.css:** The main stylesheet for the website, incorporating various styling elements and aesthetics. Utilizes CSS features such as variables, nesting, and inheritance.

- **index.scss:** Compiles into the main stylesheet -index.css- for the website, incorporating various styling elements and aesthetics. Utilizes SCSS features such as variables, nesting, and inheritance.

- **README.md:** This documentation file providing an overview of the lab, file descriptions, and additional information about the lab.

## Styling Overview

### General Styling

- Font-family "Titillium Web" is applied universally to maintain consistency throughout the website.

### Header and Footer

- The header features a left-aligned text with a dark background, providing a consistent and visually appealing navigation element.

- The footer is centrally aligned with a dark background, offering a cohesive design element across the website.

### Lists and Sections

- Unordered lists (ul) are styled with disc bullets, and list items (li) have a margin-bottom to enhance spacing.

- Sections of the website are distinguished with colored backgrounds, utilizing the classes `.mobile` and `.desktop` to manage padding for different screen sizes.

### Images

- Images are styled with unique IDs, allowing for specific positioning, widths, and heights. The use of absolute positioning and z-index ensures proper layering.

### Fun Facts Section

- The "6 Fun Facts About Me!" section includes a blue background with images and text, demonstrating a visually engaging design.

- Bootstrap columns are employed for a responsive layout, adapting to different screen sizes.

### Buttons and Links

- Buttons are styled for consistency using the class `.smaller_block`.

### Responsive Design

- The website incorporates Bootstrap 4, utilizing its grid model with at least two Bootstrap columns for responsive layout.

- A mobile-responsive `@media` query is implemented in the stylesheet to adjust styling for smaller screens.

### SCSS Features

- SCSS variables are utilized for consistent styling.

- SCSS nesting is employed for better organization and readability.

- SCSS inheritance is applied where appropriate to avoid redundancy and maintain a modular stylesheet.

- SCSS was compiled using "Live SASS Compiler".

## How to Navigate

- All pages have buttons to all other pages, enabling users to easily navigate between the pages.
